## Project goal

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the citizens of this country found a silver lining in their confinement - a platform for participation that brought together the collective brainpower of those above 35. The outcome was nothing short of incredible - a nationwide consensus of ideas and execution plans to solve a myriad of problems across different sectors.

Our task was to create a user-friendly, visually engaging interface that would motivate young people to participate actively in the issues that affect them and propose viable solutions to these problems. We were excited about the challenge because we knew that the younger generation is not only tech-savvy but also highly motivated to make a positive impact on the world.

## The Solution

To start, we conducted a research on the target demographic to understand their needs, preferences, and behavior patterns. We wanted to create a platform that would resonate with them and make them feel heard and valued. Based on our findings, we created a design that was colorful, dynamic, and interactive, with clear calls-to-action and intuitive navigation.

We also focused on creating a social and collaborative environment where young people could connect with like-minded individuals and work together to solve problems. To achieve this, we added features like forums, chat rooms, and a user-generated content section, where they could share their ideas, experiences, and feedback.
